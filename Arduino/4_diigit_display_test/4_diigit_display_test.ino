/* TM1637_4_Digit_Display_Basics.ino
The purpose of this sketch is to provide the basic
structure for using the TM1637 based 4-Digit Displays
like the Grove 4 digit display or other equivalents
available through the likes of www.dx.com. 

This makes use of the TM1637Display library developed by avishorp.
https://github.com/avishorp/TM1637

This has been developed to run on any Arduino.

Pin assignments are:
CLK - D9
DIO - D8
5V or 3.3V supply to Display
GND to Display

The operation is very simple.  The sketch initialises the display
and then steps through the loop incrementing the value of a
variable which is then displayed on the 4-Digit display.
Essentially it is the most basic function you would want from
such a display.  If you want more sophisticated functionality
then use the example that ships with the library.

#include <TM1637Display.h>

const int CLK = 9; //Set the CLK pin connection to the display
const int DIO = 8; //Set the DIO pin connection to the display


int NumStep = 0;  //Variable to interate

TM1637Display display(CLK, DIO);  //set up the 4-Digit Display.

void setup()
{
  display.setBrightness(.5);  //set the diplay to maximum brightness
}


void loop()
{
  for(NumStep = 0; NumStep < 9999; NumStep++)  //Interrate NumStep
  {
    display.showNumberDec(NumStep); //Display the Variable value;
    delay(10);  //A half second delay between steps.
  }
}
